    <h2>
        Big ball of Mud
    </h2>
    <p>The reading on the big ball of mud brings up an important discussion that is relatable to all fields of coding. It goes in depth in describing what is to be defined as mud programs; Programs that while do technically work, they have become so standardized and replicated so many times in the industry that they now infect many types of programms. While those programs still work, the problem comes in wanting to add or expand upon the code. The mud mess becomes so difficult to untangle and work around that it ends up with countless hours being wasted than of the code had been constructed correctly in the first place. It comes back to an old addage the grown ups like to say, "If you aren't going to do it right the first time, then don't do it at all." Another problem that comes from these mud balls is that because they are so readily available, companines use them all the time just to stay within their deadline inevitable adding more to the problem over time. It is definetly some food for thought in the commmunity.</p>

  <h2>Is computer programming all about coding?</h2>
  <p>To say that computer programming is all about coding seems to be missing the point. Rather than defining coding as is, the author prefers to go down a more interpretive path by relating coding to mean the final stage in a program. While differing programs may have varying degrees of steps, Brian Overland breaks down what he believes to be the most prominent. First up is system analysis, which means to figure out what it is the program does and how to best utilize resources to fix problems and make it a reality. Second comes User-interface design, which while he doesnâ€™t describe it here is basically how well the program is able to interact with the user and make it so the program is easy and intuitive to use. Program design is all about figuring out the structure of the program and making sure each layer is fully fleshed out to the best it can be. Finally, we come to the last step as stated earlier, coding. This is where you take all of the work from the prior steps and combine it using computer language. While coding may be a large part of the process, ignoring the other stages will only end up hurting the final project, which will only become more apparent as the programs grow larger and larger.</p>
