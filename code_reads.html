        Big ball of Mud
    </h2>
    <p>The reading on the big ball of mud brings up an important discussion that is relatable to all fields of coding. It goes in depth in describing what is to be defined as mud programs; Programs that while do technically work, they have become so standardized and replicated so many times in the industry that they now infect many types of programms. While those programs still work, the problem comes in wanting to add or expand upon the code. The mud mess becomes so difficult to untangle and work around that it ends up with countless hours being wasted than of the code had been constructed correctly in the first place. It comes back to an old addage the grown ups like to say, "If you aren't going to do it right the first time, then don't do it at all." Another problem that comes from these mud balls is that because they are so readily available, companines use them all the time just to stay within their deadline inevitable adding more to the problem over time. It is definetly some food for thought in the commmunity.</p>

  <h2>Is computer programming all about coding?</h2>
  <p>To say that computer programming is all about coding seems to be missing the point. Rather than defining coding as is, the author prefers to go down a more interpretive path by relating coding to mean the final stage in a program. While differing programs may have varying degrees of steps, Brian Overland breaks down what he believes to be the most prominent. First up is system analysis, which means to figure out what it is the program does and how to best utilize resources to fix problems and make it a reality. Second comes User-interface design, which while he doesn’t describe it here is basically how well the program is able to interact with the user and make it so the program is easy and intuitive to use. Program design is all about figuring out the structure of the program and making sure each layer is fully fleshed out to the best it can be. Finally, we come to the last step as stated earlier, coding. This is where you take all of the work from the prior steps and combine it using computer language. While coding may be a large part of the process, ignoring the other stages will only end up hurting the final project, which will only become more apparent as the programs grow larger and larger.</p>

  <h2>DevOps</h2>
  <p>In the fast-paced market of the 21st century, it has become more apparent that more than ever before communication is a key aspect of success. The ability to quickly respond to feedback, market changes and the continuous innovations of the modern world have been instrumental in allowing companies to turn a profit off business disruption. When DevOps was first created, it was little more than a communication and autonomation tool to support companies in the digital space. But now it has grown to more of a substantial role, providing a major backbone so some of the largest corporations out there and has been continuing to improve year after year.<br>

    IBM lays out a 7-point doctrine on why DevOps can be such a powerful tool, with some of the best examples being that; DevOps allows for easy integration into cloud computing from existing applications. DevOps can bolster disparate teams ability to communicate, using methods like the SAFe(Scaled Agility Framework environment). DevOps is highly adaptable to any team goal, process, culture, or tools. <br>Although those were just a few of the points DevOps is able to act upon, it is clear to see just how useful and versatile a tool like this can be. And no where is that more apparent than in the aforementioned case of digital/business disruption. While tech models constantly rise and fall at an unprecedented rate, DevOps can facilitate the communication and speed required to allow business to ride the waves and come out on top. This is done by DevOps following its 3 main objectives: Speed continuous information by team development, continuous delivery of that innovation by means of autonomous processing, provide a feedback loop to continue innovation optimization.<br>
