        Big ball of Mud
    </h2>
    <p>The reading on the big ball of mud brings up an important discussion that is relatable to all fields of coding. It goes in depth in describing what is to be defined as mud programs; Programs that while do technically work, they have become so standardized and replicated so many times in the industry that they now infect many types of programms. While those programs still work, the problem comes in wanting to add or expand upon the code. The mud mess becomes so difficult to untangle and work around that it ends up with countless hours being wasted than of the code had been constructed correctly in the first place. It comes back to an old addage the grown ups like to say, "If you aren't going to do it right the first time, then don't do it at all." Another problem that comes from these mud balls is that because they are so readily available, companines use them all the time just to stay within their deadline inevitable adding more to the problem over time. It is definetly some food for thought in the commmunity.</p>

  <h2>Is computer programming all about coding?</h2>
  <p>To say that computer programming is all about coding seems to be missing the point. Rather than defining coding as is, the author prefers to go down a more interpretive path by relating coding to mean the final stage in a program. While differing programs may have varying degrees of steps, Brian Overland breaks down what he believes to be the most prominent. First up is system analysis, which means to figure out what it is the program does and how to best utilize resources to fix problems and make it a reality. Second comes User-interface design, which while he doesn’t describe it here is basically how well the program is able to interact with the user and make it so the program is easy and intuitive to use. Program design is all about figuring out the structure of the program and making sure each layer is fully fleshed out to the best it can be. Finally, we come to the last step as stated earlier, coding. This is where you take all of the work from the prior steps and combine it using computer language. While coding may be a large part of the process, ignoring the other stages will only end up hurting the final project, which will only become more apparent as the programs grow larger and larger.</p>

  <h2>DevOps</h2>
  <p>In the fast-paced market of the 21st century, it has become more apparent that more than ever before communication is a key aspect of success. The ability to quickly respond to feedback, market changes and the continuous innovations of the modern world have been instrumental in allowing companies to turn a profit off business disruption. When DevOps was first created, it was little more than a communication and autonomation tool to support companies in the digital space. But now it has grown to more of a substantial role, providing a major backbone so some of the largest corporations out there and has been continuing to improve year after year.<br>

    IBM lays out a 7-point doctrine on why DevOps can be such a powerful tool, with some of the best examples being that; DevOps allows for easy integration into cloud computing from existing applications. DevOps can bolster disparate teams ability to communicate, using methods like the SAFe(Scaled Agility Framework environment). DevOps is highly adaptable to any team goal, process, culture, or tools. <br>Although those were just a few of the points DevOps is able to act upon, it is clear to see just how useful and versatile a tool like this can be. And no where is that more apparent than in the aforementioned case of digital/business disruption. While tech models constantly rise and fall at an unprecedented rate, DevOps can facilitate the communication and speed required to allow business to ride the waves and come out on top. This is done by DevOps following its 3 main objectives: Speed continuous information by team development, continuous delivery of that innovation by means of autonomous processing, provide a feedback loop to continue innovation optimization.<br>

  <h2>inevitable Pain</h2>
  <p>When developing a CBS (computer based system), it is important to consider the requirements of the code before writing the actual code itself. Failing or choosing not to do so will only end up with as what is described to be inevitable pain. An example of a code requirement would be that if you were creating a game like mastermind, you would want to make sure there were no null guesses. Making sure that the user inputs the correct number of guesses is not only essential from the game perspective, but from the coding perspective as well. No user wants to see an error code appear on there screen, much less one that the developer did not anticipate and has no error fixing script to go along with it.<br> Taking the time to think about these potential errors ahead of time will save you countless headaches, and even time because with more structure, the coding can be completed much faster than if you had to keep backtracking at every step to add in a new requirement after the main body of code had already been completed. The main thing to take away from this article is that requirements are an aspect of code that while difficult to implement, are necessary to be accurately and whole heartedly accounted for in the early stages of development, lest you wish to end up in inevitable pain.</p>

  <h2>Software is Hard</h2>
  <p>Software is hard. While both the name of the article and a quote from Donald Knuth that appears at the start of Dreaming in Code by Scott Rosenburg, it is an issue that still rears its head in even the simplest of coding ventures. Following the adventures of Mitch Kapoor, a software developer that hit it big while still being relatively young, we recount the story of Chandler, a coding project that Kapoor made not to make money, but to truly develop a revolutionary product. A rare sight to behold in the age of Silicon Valley’s rushed projects that shed quality for time constraints. Kapoor was describes by a former colleague to be in a never ending search for glory, constantly wondering whether the success he had as a younger developer was mere luck or genuine skill. In striving for greatness, shortcoming are sure to hit hard and fast, and Chandler certainly did not escape unscathed. Listing only 5 major flaws in the programming, the article delves deep into each of the mistakes the programming team made,  citing the reason for the choice in the first place and how the implementation of such code was laborious and riddled with bugs at every turn. While Chandler started development, and this article was written in 2007, Chandler was still only on version 0.7, not even in full release. <br>Codes are progressively getting larger and larger at a rate where it becomes hard to imagine just how many lines of code it might take to complete the project. But not thinking about this ahead of time is a hurdle in and of itself because if you can’t possibly envision how much time and code it might take to complete the project, than how could you even start it in the first place? Regardless of the company, budget, or scope of the idea, problems are inevitably and are constantly discovered, many being discovered for the first time with no documented solution. Software development is an incredibly complex and abstract art that it comes to the point where architecture and development of the past seems like a mere cakewalk. No matter what the project may be, you could probably bet good money on the fact that it will ship late and be way over budget.</p>
